    "title": "About Me",
    "bio": "I am a researcher passionate about bridging language, vision, and action in AI. During my bachelor’s, I explored NLP with a focus on interpretable embeddings, and later delved into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for LLMs in my master’s. My work expanded to Computer Vision, including 3D semantic segmentation and conditioning mechanisms for medical image generation. Currently, I’m driven by enhancing robot manipulation through vision-language-action models, aiming to bring nuanced physical-world understanding to AI systems. Outside of research, you’ll find me playing saxophone or coding tools to streamline my music practice.
